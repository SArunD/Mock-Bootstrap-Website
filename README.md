# Mock-Bootstrap-Website

**Goal:** To create a mock website using Bootstrap. 

I started working on this project because I wanted to increase my experience using Bootstrap, an amazing library for Web Development. I started out with just one webpage, the index.html, but, soon, I had four other pages and was creating a full-on mock website for a business/ company. This entire project took me about a week and about half of it was spent on organizing the bootstrap elements into websites and the other half was spent on styling using components provided by Bootstrap. I tried to make each webpage as responsive as possibe, meaning the different HTML elements will change depending on screen size and the level of zoom. This is to make sure that this project is uniform across all devices. 

### Checklist

- [x] Create a mock website using Bootstrap. 
- [ ] Cut down excessive and repetitive code using React.js.
- [ ] Add more back-end components, such as a "Sign In" feature.

This is a checklist and some future plans that I have for this project. One of the goals is to add some React.js into this project because most of the .html files have the same repetitive code, such as the code for the navigation bars and footers. Another goal that I have is to add some back-end features, like a "Sign-In" page and a checkout page where the webpage will remember what a signed in user did.
